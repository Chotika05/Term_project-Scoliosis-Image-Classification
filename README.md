6. Project Description

Image Classification by using Convolutional Neural Network is a project aimed at building and training deep learning models for accurate image classification tasks. It utilizes the power of CNNs to automatically extract relevant features from images and make predictions based on those features. This approach is particularly effective for tasks such as object recognition, identifying patterns, or detecting specific features within images.
This project provides a starting point for developers and researchers interested in image classification and CNNs. It offers a codebase that can be extended or modified to fit specific image classification tasks, datasets, and requirements.
